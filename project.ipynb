    "## Introduction\n",
    "An intelligent agent should be able to make descisions given some information.  In addition, such an agent should be able to learn about a new subject given some information on that subject.  In this project we will try to produce a simplified version of the described agent by creating a program that can learn about new items by asking questions about them. \n",
    "\n",
    "The agent will play a version of the 20 questions game. 20 questions is a game in which a computer will try to guess what the player is thinking based on some simple 'yes' or 'no' questions.  In this version the goal objects will consist of fruits and vegetables, and the questions will be specialized for differentiating between fruits and vegetables. \n",
    "Additionally, we will try to produce a version of the game that has the following characteristics:\n",
    "  * The game will determine which question to ask next based on which question most evenly divides the remaining possibilities and which question is most decisive.  This means that if the game has narrowed the possibilities down to 10 fruits and vegetables then the game will try to pick the next question that has 5 'yes' answers and 5 'no' answers and is most certain that the answers are correct.  \n",
    "  * If the plays plays a fruit or vegetable that the game has not heard of before then the game will add that fruit or vegetable to the database and use the players answers as the 'truth' about that fruit or vegetable.  For example, if the player is playing 'raspberry' and the game has never heard of 'raspberry' before then 'raspberry' will be added to the database and the answers that the player gave will be considered to be the 'truth' about raspberries.  If the player chooses a fruit or vegetable that hasn't been played before then player is asked to answer all questions about that fruit or vegetable so the answers will be added to the database.  \n",
    "  * If there are two fruits/vegetables that are hard to tell apart based on the questions (radishes and beets for example) the game will pick the response based on which has the highest weight, and the weights are updated each time the object is played.  \n",
    "  * The game will be able to get to the correct answer even if the player answers a question wrong.  \n",
    "  * The game will be able to add a different value for each question.  This means that a question that is frequently answered differently will not be valued as high.  This will allow the game handle uncertainties between players.      \n",
    "  \n",
    "If implemented correctly, and with enough practice, the game should be able to frequently guess the correct fruit or vegetable based on the player's input.  "

    "  * constructor\n",
    "    * (Brief) - This function initializes the twenty questions class.  \n",
    "    * (Details) - This function initializes all of the class variables of the twenty questions class, calls the $readData()$ class function to read data from files, and calls the $processData()$ class function to set up the data for use.  \n",
    "    The class variables are as follows:\n",
    "      * `answers` (dictionary) - This dictionary holds the answers to each question for each fruit and vegetable. The keys are the possible objects the player could be thinking of (ex. apple, carrot, etc.) and the values are array lists of answers for specific questions for that specific key.  \n",
    "      * `likelihood` (dictionary) - This dictionary holds the likelihood that an object (ex. apple, carrot, etc.) is the object that the player is thinking of.  The keys are the objects the player could be thinking of and the values are a float giving the likelihood for each object.  \n",
    "      * `prevAnswers` (dictionary) - This dictionary holds a 0 to 1 value that represents the mean of past yes/no answers to each question.   The keys are the objects and the values are a list which holds the mean of past yes/no answers to each question.\n",
    "      * `timesPlayed` (dictionary) - For each object, this dictionary holds the number of times that question has been played.

    "### Playing an object that is known by the game (banana)\n",
    "Below is an example of the game selecting the correct answer.  Each time a question is answered we can see the how the likelihood is updated in the list of tuples.  The first element of the tuple is the object and the second element is the likelihood that the object is what the player is thinking.  If a certain object's likelihood is too low (the difference between the largest likelihood and the likelihood for a given object is larger than a specified threshold) then it is dropped from the list.  For example, we can see that several of the possibilities are dropped from the list after the game asks \"Is it a fruit?\".  Additionally, the game can reintroduce possibilities if the likelihood of an object grows to be within the threshold.  For example, we see 'apple' has re-emerged as a possibility afte the game asks \"Is it commonly found on a sandwich?\".  Additionally, the game is capable of getting the correct answer even if one (or possibly a few) questions have been answered incorrectly.  For example, the question \"Is it crunchy when raw?\" was answered with a 'yes', but this question should have been answered with a 'no'.  Even though one question was answered incorrectly the game was able to come up with 'banana' as the most likely answer (although, it may have taken a few more questions to determine the answer). "
